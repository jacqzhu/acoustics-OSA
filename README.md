# Acoustic Features Analysis for Obstructive Sleep Apnea
This repository contains code and analyses for acoustic feature data collected from April 16 to May 14, 2025. 
The project was a part of my summer internship at KITE Research Institute, where I  developed an audio processing and explainable MLP pipeline to identify voice biomarkers of OSA.
